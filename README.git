As of the time this file was created, the cscope source in
Git revision control no longer carries any of the
autotools-generated files.  That means you have to run
some extra steps, compared to using a tarball or
older check-out.

In a nutshell, you need reasonably fresh autoconf and automake.
Then you can run

	autoreconf -i -s

That should put things into a state where you can use the
normal procedure described in the "INSTALL" file.
